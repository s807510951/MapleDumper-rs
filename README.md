# MapleDumper

[![CI](https://github.com/TajuC/MapleDumper-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TajuC/MapleDumper-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A fast AOB / pattern scanner and offset dumper for Windows x64 (and x86) processes. MapleDumper
attaches to a running process, scans the target module with an AVX2-accelerated masked matcher,
resolves the matches into stable **module-relative RVAs**, and emits a reusable C/C++ header, a
Cheat Engine table, or a plain report.

It ships as a **frameless desktop workspace** and a **scriptable command-line tool**, both built
on the same engine crate.

## Highlights

**Engine**
- **Read/scan pipeline** — one reader streams large blocks of the target's memory (one read at a
  time, so the kernel never serializes competing reads) while the rayon thread-pool scans blocks
  as they arrive. The scan overlaps the cross-process read and effectively hides under it.
- AVX2 masked matcher that anchors each pattern on its **rarest fixed byte** (static frequency
  table), with a scalar fallback selected at runtime.
- Scans **executable regions only** by default (where code signatures live), with a one-switch
  fallback to the full module — so a live dump reads far fewer bytes.
- **Wait-and-attach** — point it at a process that is not running yet and it polls, then attaches
  the instant the process and module appear (cancellable).
- Suffix-driven resolvers: RIP-relative / `rel32` pointers, nested calls, struct displacements,
  and packet-header immediates, arch-aware for x64 and x86.
- Output as deterministic, sorted, de-duplicated module RVAs — immune to ASLR.

**Desktop workspace** (`maple-app`)
- Frameless dark dashboard: target toolbar, status-colored results table grouped by category, and
  a metadata inspector (RVA, absolute address, signature, type, hit count, notes).
- Built-in **pattern manager** (add / edit / delete / notes) and a syntax-highlighted **editor**.
- **Privacy mask** — one click blurs every signature (table, inspector, editor, and the edit
  dialog) so you can screenshot without exposing your patterns. Visual only; the data is untouched.
- Live **scan metrics** — scanned size, effective throughput, and attach time.
- One-click export to `offsets.h`, a Cheat Engine table, or plain text.
- **Fully offline** — the editor is vendored into the binary and a strict Content-Security-Policy
  blocks every remote origin. The app makes no network requests, ever.

**Command line** (`maple-cli`)
- The same scan and output pipeline, suitable for scripting and CI.

## Workspace layout

| Crate        | Role                                                                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `maple-core` | The engine: pattern parsing, the SIMD scanner, process memory access, the resolver, the scan pipeline, and the output writers. |
| `maple-app`  | The desktop workspace — a Rust backend with an embedded web UI (Tauri).        |
| `maple-cli`  | The command-line front end.                                                    |

## Build

Requires a stable Rust toolchain (MSVC) and the Windows SDK. The desktop app needs the
[WebView2 runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) at run time, which
ships with current versions of Windows.

```
cargo build --release
```

- Desktop app: `target/release/maple-app.exe`
- CLI: `target/release/mapledumper.exe`

Run elevated so `OpenProcess` and `SeDebugPrivilege` succeed against a protected target.

## Desktop workspace

Launch `maple-app.exe`. In the Workspace view:

1. Enter the **target process** (e.g. `MapleStory.exe`) and the **module** to scan.
2. Pick the architecture. Leave **Wait for target** on to attach the moment the process starts, or
   switch to **Find by window class** to locate it by class instead of name. **Code regions only**
   (on by default) scans executable memory; turn it off to scan the whole module.
3. Load or edit your pattern list (Patterns / Editor views), then press **Start Scan**.
4. Inspect any result, then **Export** an `offsets.h`, a Cheat Engine table, or a plain report.

Use the **eye** button in the title bar to mask signatures before sharing a screenshot.

## Command line

```
mapledumper (--process <name> | --class <window-class>) [options]

  --process <name>   attach by process name (e.g. MapleStory.exe)
  --class <class>    attach by top-level window class
  --module <name>    module to scan (default: process name)
  --patterns <file>  pattern file (default: patterns.txt)
  --arch <32|64>     architecture section to load (default: 64)
  --out <dir>        output directory (default: .)
  --ce               write update.txt as a Cheat Engine table
  --no-wait          do not wait for the process; fail if it is not running
  --timeout <secs>   give up waiting after this many seconds
  -h, --help         print help
```

```
mapledumper --process MapleStory.exe --patterns patterns.txt --out .
```

## Patterns

Each non-empty line defines one signature. Accepted forms:

```
Name = AA BB ?? CC
Name: 0xAA ?? CC
Name AA ?? CC
```

- **Wildcards:** `?` or `??`. Commas between bytes are allowed.
- **Notes / comments:** text after `;` or `#` is captured as the symbol's note (and shown in the
  app); a leading `#` line is a comment.
- **Architecture sections:** `#32BIT` / `#64BIT` headers select which block is loaded. Patterns
  before any section apply to both.
- **Category sections:** `[name]` sets the namespace used for the following symbols in `offsets.h`
  (default `globals`).

Name suffixes select how a match is resolved:

| Suffix   | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `_PTR`   | Resolve a RIP-relative load (`mov`/`lea`/`cmp`/SSE) or `rel32` jmp/call. |
| `_CALL`  | Treat the match as a call and resolve the (nested) call target.         |
| `_OFF`   | Extract a struct member displacement (emitted as a raw offset).         |
| `_HDR`   | Extract an immediate operand, e.g. a packet header opcode.              |
| _(none)_ | Emit the match address itself.                                          |

See `patterns.sample.txt` for a worked example.

## Output

- **`offsets.h`** — module-relative RVAs grouped by category:

  ```c
  #pragma once
  #include <cstdint>

  // module-relative RVAs for MapleStory.exe (base 0x140000000)
  namespace maple {
      namespace globals {
          inline constexpr uintptr_t
              CClickBase = 0x9E9568,
              CUserLocal = 0x9E9298;
      }
  }
  ```

  RVAs are relative to the module base, so they remain valid across restarts (add the runtime
  module base to rebase). `_OFF` symbols are raw struct offsets.

- **`update.txt`** — a plain report by default, or a Cheat Engine table with `--ce`
  (`define(Name, "module"+RVA)` / `registersymbol(Name)`).

## How it works

1. Enable `SeDebugPrivilege`, locate the process by name or window class, and open it with
   `PROCESS_VM_READ` (waiting for it to appear if requested).
2. Enumerate the module's committed regions — executable only by default — and coalesce adjacent
   ones.
3. Stream the regions through the pipeline: a reader issues large `NtReadVirtualMemory` reads
   (tolerating partial copies) while the thread-pool scans each block with the AVX2 masked matcher
   as soon as it lands, so reading and scanning overlap.
4. Resolve each match according to its suffix and convert addresses to module RVAs.
5. Emit `offsets.h`, a Cheat Engine table, or a plain report.

## Performance

The matcher anchors each pattern on its **rarest fixed byte** (a static frequency table), not the
first one, so common bytes like `0x48` (REX.W) don't flood the prefilter. It uses an AVX2 path
chosen at runtime via `is_x86_feature_detected!` with a scalar fallback, and read buffers use
uninitialized capacity to skip a redundant zeroing pass.

Synthetic throughput (criterion `cargo bench`, 8 MiB code-like buffer): the rarest-byte anchor
scans at **~29 GiB/s**, versus **~0.8 GiB/s** when forced onto a common byte like `0x48` — about a
**37x** difference, which is exactly why the anchor heuristic exists.
(`cargo run --release --example throughput` is a dependency-light equivalent.)

Against a **live** process the wall clock is bound by the cross-process *read*, not the match.
`NtReadVirtualMemory` is the lowest documented user-mode read primitive (`ReadProcessMemory` merely
wraps it), and it copies a running target's memory at roughly **0.5 GB/s** — and concurrent reads
don't help, because the kernel serializes reads against the target's address space. So the engine
reads continuously on one thread and overlaps the (far faster) scan on the pool, hiding it under
the read, and reads executable regions only to keep the byte count down. A full live dump of a
~140 MB code section finishes in under ~0.3 s.

Deliberately not used: `PssCaptureSnapshot` gives a consistent snapshot but throttles reads to
~30 MB/s; a kernel driver (`MmCopyVirtualMemory`) could read faster but conflicts with anti-cheat;
reading the image from disk is fast but misses the target's runtime state. AVX-512 / Teddy
multi-pattern prefilters were skipped because the scan is already hidden under the read.
